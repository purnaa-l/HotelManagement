# HotelManagement
This is the repository for the hotel management website that I built. 

Aura Suites is a resort and hotel management system designed to streamline bookings and enhance administrative efficiency. The application's front end is developed primarily using  HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS, incorporating the Flexbox grid for responsive design and optimal user experience. The web application also features JavaScript, JQuery, and JQuery UI on the front end to power other functionalities.   The backend database is managed with MySQL, and PHP 8.3 handles backend coding, ensuring smooth communication between the front and back end. The system is hosted on an Apache web server (XAMPP). 

Aura Suites allows guests to easily navigate the website, check room availability, and manage bookings.   

The project aims to develop a user interface portal for managing room allotment in a hotel/resort. It will enable online room booking and allow guests to check their allotment status. A dedicated control panel will also be provided for hotel/resort administrators to enhance operational efficiency. The software will include functionality to retrieve information from the database and perform validation processes dynamically. The project's principal objective includes exploring various data structures, database management, and data processing systems. This software will also include the code to retrieve information dynamically from the database and validate it. The entire design will be user-friendly. 

The designed software is a great tool and finds numerous practical applications such as booking resorts, serviced apartments, or homestays. The salient features of this software include 

• Appealing and Elegant Home page describing various facilities of the Hotel 
• Ready availability details of rooms on the home page itself  
• A guest has to register, and he can log in under the "User login" option.   
• Every user has a dashboard that will show the status of their requests.  
• Users can submit new requests.  
• The hotel admin has a control panel through which he gets the consolidation list of all requests. 
• Admin can allot requests, reject, and cancel requests based on need and availability. 
• Auto Email information to users when the request is submitted and confirmation on the allotment if rejected by admin or cancelled by admin.  
• Security features like direct and unauthorised access to associate / linked webpages and user validations, Date picker from the calendar, and validation of every field of data submission are incorporated.  
• Forgot password / Password restoration options
